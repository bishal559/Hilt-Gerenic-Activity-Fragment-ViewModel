# Hilt-Gerenic-Activity-Fragment-ViewModel
Hilt-Generic-Activity-Fragment-ViewModel is an Android architectural pattern that combines Hilt for dependency injection, Activity/Fragment for UI presentation, and ViewModel for data and logic management. It promotes code reuse, modularity, and clean architecture in Android app development.
Hilt-Generic-Activity-Fragment-ViewModel

Hilt-Generic-Activity-Fragment-ViewModel is an Android architectural pattern that combines Hilt, Activity, Fragment, and ViewModel to provide a structured and efficient approach to data and logic management in Android apps.

Overview

This architectural pattern leverages the following components:

Hilt: A dependency injection library provided by Google, simplifying dependency injection and reducing boilerplate code.
Activity: Represents a single screen with a user interface.
Fragment: A reusable portion of a user interface.
ViewModel: Manages UI-related data in a lifecycle-aware manner, promoting separation of concerns and facilitating code maintainability.
By using Hilt for dependency injection, dependencies can be easily injected into Activity and Fragment classes. The ViewModel is then utilized within these UI components to handle data and logic. The pattern encourages code reuse and modularity by making the ViewModel generic and shareable across multiple activities or fragments.

Key Benefits

Promotes code reuse and modularity.
Simplifies dependency management through Hilt.
Separates data management and logic from the UI layer.
Facilitates clean architecture and maintainable code.
Usage

To implement the Hilt-Generic-Activity-Fragment-ViewModel pattern in your Android app:

Set up Hilt in your project by following the official Hilt documentation.
Create your Activity and Fragment classes, and annotate them with @AndroidEntryPoint to enable Hilt injection.
Implement your ViewModel class, extending ViewModel, and define the necessary data and logic.
Inject dependencies into your ViewModel using Hilt annotations, such as @Inject.
Use the ViewModel within your Activity or Fragment to handle data and logic, while keeping the UI layer separate and lightweight.
